JDK-java develpoment kit
JVM-java vertical mechine
JRE-java runtime environment
JDK,JVM,JRE are platform dependent
JVM is dependenton byte code
JVM is used in runtime or execution and it is present in JRE 
JVM has development tools and JRE has set of libries

java is a object oriented programming language and java is platform indepentend programming language because java is write once 
 run anywhere(WORA)
 
 Datatypes:the variables which stores the values
 2 different types of data types :primitive data type and non-primitive data type
 primitive data types are int,char,float,short,long,double,boolean,byte
 primitive data types are inbulid by the java
 non-primitive data types whichs starts with uppercase letter (String,Array...)
 non-primitive data types are written by the users
 class Akhila{
static int age;
static char A;
static float num;
static double details;
static long password;
static short address;
static boolean completed;
static byte homename;
public static void main(String args[]){
System.out.println("the akhila age is "+age);
System.out.println("the akhila a is"+A);
System.out.println("the akhila details is"+detailes);
System.out.println("the akhila password is"+password);
System.out.println("the akhila completed is"+completed);
System.out.println("the akhila homename is"+homename);
}
}
 
variables:it is a container in which data values are stored
their are four types of variables :static variable,local variable,instance variable,parameter variable

Access specifier.written type.main(String []);
class calculator(){
 public static void main(String cal[]){
 System.out.println("main started")
 add (23);
 add(54);
 System.out.println("main ended")
 }
 public static int void(int num1,int num2){
 intnum1num2=int num1+num2;
 System.out.println(num1num2);
 }
 }
Method: is a block of code which perform certain functionalies or actions

<!DOCTYPE html> indicates the type of file name
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<h1>heading</h1>
<h6>heading</h6>
</head>
<body>
<p>method is a block of code which perform certain functionalies or actions</p>
<p>method is a block of code which perform certain functionalies or actions</p>
</body>
</html>
Array:is a container in which holdes a similar kid of data

fundamentals:
keywords:resured words which have some specfice meaning
50+3 keywords are present(true,false,null also considered as keywords)
48+2(goto,const-will no be used)
literals are considered as valuein java (ex:int age=70;string name="baba")(true,false,null used as literals)
identifiers:names given to class,variable and methods
allowed identifiers are
uppercase AtoZ
lowercase atoz
0to9
$and_
new it is a keyword or operator which helps to creat a multiple copy of java
class&object:
object=is order to creat a multiple copy of class
class=which contains states and behaviour(desigen,templete)
states are refered as variables (fields/data members/properties)and behaviour referd as method(functionalies,purpose)
variable decleration for class called as state
object=designed once and used multipled types
constructor=same name as classname with dos not have any return type 
is used to initialize the instance variables
overloading has 2 types=method overloading and constructor overloading 
codestrip=practice website
this()==achive constructor chaining
this==avoid ambidity btw instance and 
when we call a method again nd again is called stackoverflowerror.
constructor is used to initialize objects or used to initialize instance variable of class
